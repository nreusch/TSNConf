# Results - Scalability Evaluation
To evaluate the scalability, we ran both the CP and the SA solutions on the same test cases with the same computing resources.

The following files are provided:
- Results for each testcase as .csv
- A script to merge these results and select the best one for SA: merge_best_results.py
- A jupyter notebook showcasing the calculation of Table. III in the paper: scalability_analysis.ipynb
- A folder containing the ParamILS configuration used for SA: paramILS/

The used testcases can be found in: testcases/scalability/
